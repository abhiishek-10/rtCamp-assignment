# Description
This gutenberg custom block plugin does not use any kind of third party libraries as instructed on https://rtcamp.com/assignments/wordpress-engineer-front-end/ 
This plugin is made using plain javascript and not jsx and not even jQuery for the frontend slider. The slider on the frontend side is purely made using js and css.

After adding the plugin directory and installing it, you'll have to look for "Latest Post Slider" under the "Media" category.

By default, it will fetch latest posts from wptavern.com, but you can change it to any public WP REST API endpoint.
